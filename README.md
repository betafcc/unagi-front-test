# Unagi Frontend Test

## Steps

### 1. Show a single static card on `/collection` page
- ✅ Basic

Bonus points (can be done in arbitrary order):
- ✅ Add TS types/interfaces where applicable.
- ✅ Convert code to fetch the player image without having the full URL,
  but by generating it with the existing ID.

- ✅ Implement simple lazy loading for the player image, show loading indicator
  while the image is loading.

This one was pretty hard and I was surprised there wasn't an easy lib to handle the behaviour I wanted, here is what I implemented:

Images only start loading when the img element is on the screen, and, while image is not loaded, render a loading skeleton

Check [the source file](./src/pages/LazyImage.tsx)

- ✅ Format player DOB in a human-readable way.

NOTE: there is an obvious way, by just doing `new Date().toLocaleDateString()`, which would give the format '6/26/2024' for 'en-us' and '26/06/2024' to almost everyone else, but I'm interpreting the "human-readable" to be something in the lines of "26 June 2024"/"26 juin 2024" for "en-us"/"fr"

### 2. Fetch collection from a fake REST API
- ✅ Basic

Bonus points (can be done in arbitrary order):

- ✅ Add loading state in the UI.
- ✅ Handle error state, e.g. if the server returns 500.

About these last two points, I would normally use [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) and maybe the `Suspense` API, that automatically handles loading and error state, but I'm assuming this part should be done by hand to show that I know how to do basic data fetching without libs.

- ✅ Implement a reusable card component.

Already implemented on previous step

- ❌ Replace existing plain CSS styles with Styled Components if you see the benefits.

While I do have a ton of experience with styled-components, I haven't used it in a while (in favor of tailwind) and didn't want to waste time setting it up and porting the styles already done

- ✅ Add TS types/interfaces in React components where applicable.
